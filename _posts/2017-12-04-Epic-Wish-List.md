### The Epic / Haiku / Cantu Wishlist
Ho, ho, ho …it's that time of year. What I wish Santa Judy Faulkner and her elves up in Madison would deliver.
<!--excerpt-->

#### Room to breathe when writing patient notes
27%. That is the vertical height (% of pixels) of the note composition space that Epic's developers have allotted for clinicians.

Just look at all that dead space currently being wasted on nothingness.

<amp-img src="{{page.thumbnail-image}}"
   layout="responsive" alt="{{page.thumbnail-description}}" height="{{page.thumbnail-image-height}}" width="{{page.thumbnail-image-width}}"></amp-img>

A UI providing a dismal amount of real estate for composition results in excessive scrolling and wasted time.
