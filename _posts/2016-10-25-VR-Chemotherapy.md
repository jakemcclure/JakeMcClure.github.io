Digging in to how leveraging the capabilities of VR can improve the patient experience in & with the healthcare system.

<!-- excerpt -->

Virtual reality offers the ultimate escapism. For physicians and other healthcare professionals, it allows us to escape many. historic restraints in medical education & training. It opens up endless possibilities with regard to patient simulated learning (eg team-based crisis learning, surgical simulation).

But, the patient experience in healthcare arguably stands to benefit even more than medical education. I believe there is an incredible opportunity to enrich the patient experience in & with the healthcare system via leveraging the capabilities of VR.

## Chemotherapy
For cancer patients undergoing chemotx, the infusion routine of sitting patiently in a chair surrounded by others persevering through the same battle while IV medications run in can become quite monotonous. For some they are accompanied by friends or family; some go at it alone.

It can be psychologically taxing, but VR provides the chance to flip the script. Need some R&R? Travel discouraged because chemotx renders the system immunocompromised? …Bring the R&R to the bedside. Put on a goofy-looking headset and enjoy virtual Bora Bora, for example – turning that infusion center chair into a cabana.

Seeking a little adventure? …click a button and head a little south to the Great Barrier Reef or the outback of Australia.

With VR, monotony morphs into marvel.
